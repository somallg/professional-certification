# 6. Error Handling

## 6.1 Domains
* Domains provide a way to handle multiple different IO operations as a single group
* If any of the event emitters or callbacks registered to a domain emit an `error` event, or throw an error, then the domain object will be notified, rather than losing the context of the error or causing the program to exit immediately

## 6.2 Exceptions
* Errors can occur explicitly, implicitly, on an error event or as a callback argument

## 6.3 Error objects
* Error object is a built-in object that provides a standard set of useful information when an error occurs, such as a stack trace and the error message
