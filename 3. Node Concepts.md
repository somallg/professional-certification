# 3. Node Concepts

## 3.1 Event loop
* Entity that handles and processes external events and converts them into callback invocations

## 3.2 Callbacks
* At an I/O call, your code saves the callback and returns control to the runtime environment. The callback will be called later when that data actually is available

## 3.2 Event emitters
* In Node.js an event can be described simply as a string with a corresponding callback
* An event can be "emitted" multiple times or you can choose to only listen for the first time it is emitted

## 3.3 Streams
* Stream instances are basically Unix pipes
* They can be readable, writable or both

## 3.4 Buffers
* Buffers are instances of the Buffer class in Node, which is designed to handle raw binary data
* Each buffer corresponds to some raw memory allocated outside V8

## 3.5 JavaScript closures
* A closure is an inner function that has access to the outer (enclosing) function's variables - scope chain
