# 1. Philosophy and Features

## 1.1 Performances
* Scale up (getting a bigger machine)
    * expensive
* Scale out (partitioning data across more machines)
    * cheaper and more scalable
    * more difficult to administer a thousand machines than it is to care for one

# Basic
* Document: an ordered set of keys with associated values
    * Keys in document are strings
    * Any UTF-8 character is allowed
    * Keys must not contains the character \0
    * The . and $ are reserved character
    * Type-sensitive and case-sensitive. These documents are distinct:
        * {'foo': 3}, {'foo': '3'}
        * {'foo': 3}, {'Foo': 3}
    * Cannot contain duplicate keys    
    * Key/value pairs in documents are ordered: {'x': 1, 'y': 2} and {'y': 2, 'x': 1} are not the same

* Collection: group of documents. Document ~ row, collection ~ table
    * The empty string ("") is not a valid collection name
    * Collection names may not contain the character \0
    * You should not create any collection that start with *system.*
    * User-created collections should not contain the reserved character $ in the name
    
* Subcollections: namespaced separated by the . character
    * For organizational purposes only
    * Useful and incorporated into many MongoDB tools: GridFS, drivers

* Databases: group of collections
    * Has it own permissions, and each database is stored in separate files on disk
    * Database names can be any UTF-8 string
    * Empty string ("") is not valid database name
    * A database name cannot contain any of these characters: /, \, ., ", *, <, >, :, |, ?, $, (single space), or \0
    * Case-sensitive, even on non-case-sensitive filesystems
    * Database names are limited to a maximum of 64 bytes
    * Database names will actually end up as files on filesystem
    * Reserved database name:
        * *admin* - root database, in term of authentication
        * *local* - will never be replicated
        * *config* - store information about the shards
    
## 1.2 JSON
* Types: null, boolean, numeric, string, array, and object
* No date type
* No way to differentiate floats and integers

## 1.3 BSON
* Binary serialization format used to store documents and make remote procedure calls in MongoDB
* Types: MinKey, Null, Numbers, Symbol (String), Object, Array, BinData, ObjectId, Boolean, Date, Timestamp, Regular Expression, MaxKey

## 1.4 Fault Tolerance (concepts)
* Number of members that can become unavailable and still leave enough members in the set to elect a primary
* Difference between the number of members in the set and the majority needed to elect a primary

## 1.5 Disaster Recovery (concepts)
* Backup from failover

## 1.6 Horizontal Scaling (concepts)
* Add more machines to support data growth and the demands of read and write operations

## 1.7 The Mongo Shell
* Interactive JavaScript interface
* Component of MongoDB package
